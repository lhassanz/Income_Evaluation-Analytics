# Income_Evaluation-Business_Analytics
This is the final project that involves analyzing the multiple traits of an individual and seeing if we can properly predict their income level based on the dataset. Done both in R and Python, with different approaches, visualizations, and methods.

Description:

•	Member of a group project whose goal was to analyze an individual’s annual income results from various factors such as an individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc. 
•	Gather real and credible income dataset recorded by the U.S Census Bureau and created R and Python code (using RStudio) to clean/organize data.
•	Preformed analysis of our data removing any variables that will not provide any useful insight in calculations such as Qualitative variables (i.e., Marital Status, age, etc.).  Also produced data visualization of our findings for Quantitative variables.
•	Applied our data through multiple types of data analysis methods (i.e., K Nearest Method, Decision Tree, etc.) and after comparisons of different methods, narrowing down to Logistic Regression.
